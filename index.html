            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p> Hey everyone, I wanted to share some exciting with you! After much
              thought and consideration, I've decided that college isn't the right
              path for me at the moment. Instead, I'm following my passion for web
              design. I believe that learning and honing my web design skills will
              open up amazing opportunities in the tech industry. I'm excited to
              embark on this journey and continue to improve my design and
              development skills, learn coding, and create stunning websites. I'm
              looking forward to the challenges and growth that lie ahead. Your
              support means the world to me, and I'm grateful for the encouragement
              and belief in my dreams. Let's stay connected as I embark on this
              creative adventure!</p>
